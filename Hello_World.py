"""
This function defines a simple program that prints "Hello World!" to the console when run. 
The use of the if __name__ == "__main__": block is a common practice in Python to ensure 
that certain code is only executed when the script is run directly and the main function is called.
The aim was to establish a test connection with GitHub.
